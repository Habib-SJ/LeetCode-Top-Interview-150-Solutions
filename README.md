>Welcome to the LeetCode Top Interview 150 project.
This repository contains my personal solutions to the Top 150 most frequently asked interview problems on LeetCode, implemented in Python.
I'm solving these problems gradually, and the goal is to provide clear, well-documented solutions to help understand common patterns in data structures and algorithms — especially for coding interview preparation.
------------------------------------------------
## 📌 Structure

- `python/`: Python solutions.
---

## 🛠️ Example Solution folder

Each solution file usually contains:
- Problem title (as comment)
- Problem Id (as comment)

- Solution code

Example in `python/main.py`:

```python
# Problem: Sum of Two Numbers
# ID : 12345


a, b = map(int, input().split())
print(a + b)

Happy Coding! 🚀
